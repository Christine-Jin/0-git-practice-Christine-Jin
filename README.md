## Why I find this interesting

It states that "a notable fact about computer engineers: according to the 2025 Developer Skills Report, over 79% of developers prefer hybrid or remote work." I think it implies that software engineers love to coding with a comfortable environment.

A thought-provoking detail is that “developers write only about 10 lines of effective code per day on average.” This shatters the common perception of programmers “furiously typing away,” instead revealing the true nature of development work: more time is spent thinking through logic, debugging errors, and optimizing architecture, with actual coding comprising only a small portion of the entire process. This “slow and steady wins the race” approach also explains why the development cycle for high-quality software often takes longer than anticipated.
